    "The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). \n",

    "Select two large prime numbers, `x` and `y` and calculate `n = x*y`.\n",

    "- The prime numbers need to be large so that they will be difficult for someone to figure out.\n",

    "- The pair of numbers `(n, e)` makes up the public key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate d such that `e.d = 1 mod t(n)`. This can be found using the extended euclidean algorithm.\n",
